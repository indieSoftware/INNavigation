# INNavigation

Provides easy access to the app screen navigation and thus replaces SwiftUI's `NavigationLink`.

## Usage

This is actually a wrapper lib around the navigation code from [https://store.rebeloper.com/navigation-stack](https://store.rebeloper.com/navigation-stack)

Follow the link above to see how to use this lib after importing it to a project or opening the lib's example or demo project.

The `NavigationStackDemo` is the official demo application to showcase how to use the library.

### Maintenance

**Current Rebeloper source version**: v.1.0.0+

When Rebeloper provides an updated version of his code simply download the new zipped code (log-in secured) and replace the old code in the `INNavigation/NavigationStack` folder with the unzipped new code.

If necessary, replace the `NavigationStackDemo` folder with the new demo code if available.

Keep in mind that the demo project already comes with the navigation code embedded and thus doesn't use the lib nor its wrapped code. Theoretically, that might cause problems when the lib's code and the demo's navigation code differ. However, for the sake of simplicity and maintainability, we assume that Rebeloper provides the correct code.
