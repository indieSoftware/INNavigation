# INNavigation

Provides easy access to the app screen navigation and thus replaces SwiftUI's `NavigationLink`.

## Usage

This is actually a wrapper lib around the navigation code from [https://store.rebeloper.com/navigation-stack](https://store.rebeloper.com/navigation-stack)

Follow the link above to see how to use this lib after importing this lib to a project or opening the lib's example project.

### Maintenance

When Rebeloper provides an updated version of his code simply download the new zipped code and replace the one in the `NavigationStack` folder with the unzipped code.

If necessary, replace the example project's code with the new demo code if available.
